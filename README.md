# TriviaGame

Uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Jquery, and Giphy API.<br><br>

This app uses the Giphy API to make a dynamic web page that populates
with gifs of lovable pooches. Ten breeds are represented with their own button, and ten gifs are displayed per click. Each new batch of gifs are
prepended to the others. Users may also enter a new breed.
